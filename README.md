# 100-Days-of-Code
This is my journal of the code I do as part of the 100 days of code challenge. 

The plan I have for this is pretty simple. I follow the path from Angela Yu's course on Udemy...
### 100 Days of Code - The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp for 2021 

you can find the course here - https://www.udemy.com/share/103IHM2@PkdjfV1dSVcLd0ZLO2JOfhRt/

If you come across this repo in the initial days, expect to find some silly stuff that has no real application other than to serve as a coding activity. But I am pretty optimistic and plan on sticking to this Challenge, even if its just to fill up this repo.
