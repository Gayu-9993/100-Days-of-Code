# Day 7 of coding : 

Welcome to the game of Hangman. 

The rules are simple for this game, you get a random word, and you get 6 chances/lives to guess the word correctly one letter at a time. The correct letters will fill the blanks making it easier for you to guess, but guessing characters that are not a part of the word or repeating characters you've already said, will lead to the loss of a life..(yes, even if the repeated character is in the word). 

At the end of the game, either you guess the correctly, or the man hangs. Click on the executable file to dive into the game. 

A life is now in your hands....play responsibly!
