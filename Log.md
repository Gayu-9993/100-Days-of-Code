# Log of my progress in the 100-Days-of-Code Challenge : 

### Day 1: July 01, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Strings and Variables...Yay!!!

**Thoughts:** Since it is just Day 1 , the load was on the lighter side. More time to figure out how to use git...

### Day 2: July 02, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Type casting, operators and fstrings. 

**Thoughts:** First I'm seeing fstrings. real useful, those. also, did a teeny program to calculate the days until you reach 90 and inevitably die. Dark, but I am still proud of it.

### Day 3: July 03, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Conditional statements and logical operators.  

**Thoughts:** Mostly basic stuff. The project was to develop a treasure hunt game, and although it wasn't that difficult, I had fun thinking of possible scenarios.

### Day 4: July 04, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Lists and the random module.  

**Thoughts:** The course content was easy. Project request was to develop a simple game of Rock Paper Scissors. I did one for that, and then tweaked it so I could keep playing for a while as compared to the 1 execution - 1 game format in the course solution. 

I also developed a code for hand-cricket..its a game that tries to mimic the essense of cricket. Please refer the rules file for more info.

### Day 5: July 05, 2021

**Today's Progress**: 'for' loops.  

**Thoughts:** Today's project was to create a password generator. Had to look into the sample and join methods to make the password more random. But otherwise, the job was easy

### Day 6: July 06, 2021

**Today's Progress**: functions and while loops.  

**Thoughts:** Finally arrived at creating our own functions. The interactive challenges and the final project was done in a web app called REEBORG's world, the link for which, is available in the Day 6 folder

### Day 7: July 07, 2021

**Today's Progress**: developing a Hangman game.  

**Thoughts:** Finally, a day that was interesting. Had to look up a lot of things like the os library to clear the screen, and enumerate() to get the positions of characters.

### Day 8: July 08, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Code for Caesar cipher

**Thoughts:** Got to use some functions as part of the actual course content. Missed a key logic for the shift values being greater than the number of alphabets until I checked the solution for the final comparison, but corrected it. And I got to do it without repeating the alphabet set like in the course solution, so I am happy about that.

### Day 9: July 09, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Code for Silent Auction

**Thoughts:** Nested dictionaries and lists were a bit confusing, escpecially there were multiple branches. But managed to overcome that.

### Day 10: July 10, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Functions and recursions

**Thoughts:** recursions, returns and multiple function definitions. Varied on the projection execution from the course method.

### Day 11: July 11, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Code for a game of Blackjack

**Thoughts:** Understanding the logic behind the actual game was more difficult than programming it.

### Day 12: July 12, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Code for a game of 'Guess The Number'

**Thoughts:** First time I heard about functions defined inside functions and their scope. Although I didn't use it for the project, it is useful information

### Day 13: July 13, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Debugging snippets of code 

**Thoughts:** The code snippets given were pretty easy to debug. However need to read about pep8 rules as well for better uniformity

### Day 14: July 14, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Game of Higher - Lower 

**Thoughts:** The requirement itself wasn't too hard, and it was fun to develop. Need to look into the PEP8 coding guidelines for better organization of code.

### Day 15: July 15, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Code for a Coffee machine

**Thoughts:** The exercise was a little challenging since I wanted to implement fail safes for all inputs and wanted to do so in the shortest way possible. But I guess this exercise is worthy of being called the first one in the Intermediate difficulty level in the course.

### Day 16: July 16, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Code for a Coffee  - OOP Version

**Thoughts:** Felt really proud when I finally figured it out. But this program just served to remind of why I loathe OOP. Also, all the classes and methods, attributes were presented in the starter code, and didn't really change them, except increasing the ingredients quantity to a thousand each.

### Day 17: July 17, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Code for game of Trivia

**Thoughts:** Today's coding exercise was intended to get us familiarized with classes and objects and the whole OOP concept. It was interesting.

### Day 18: July 18, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Mimicing Damien Hirst's paintings

**Thoughts:** Today's coding exercise was to mimic Damien Hirst's popular spot paintings using colorgram and Turtle modules. The Turtle module especially was really interesting to use.
