# Log of my progress in the 100-Days-of-Code Challenge : 

### Day 1: July 01, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Strings and Variables...Yay!!!

**Thoughts:** Since it is just Day 1 , the load was on the lighter side. More time to figure out how to use git...

### Day 2: July 02, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Type casting, operators and fstrings. 

**Thoughts:** First I'm seeing fstrings. real useful, those. also, did a teeny program to calculate the days until you reach 90 and inevitably die. Dark, but I am still proud of it.

### Day 3: July 03, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Conditional statements and logical operators.  

**Thoughts:** Mostly basic stuff. The project was to develop a treasure hunt game, and although it wasn't that difficult, I had fun thinking of possible scenarios.

### Day 4: July 04, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Lists and the random module.  

**Thoughts:** The course content was easy. Project request was to develop a simple game of Rock Paper Scissors. I did one for that, and then tweaked it so I could keep playing for a while as compared to the 1 execution - 1 game format in the course solution. 

I also developed a code for hand-cricket..its a game that tries to mimic the essense of cricket. Please refer the rules file for more info.

### Day 5: July 05, 2021

**Today's Progress**: 'for' loops.  

**Thoughts:** Today's project was to create a password generator. Had to look into the sample and join methods to make the password more random. But otherwise, the job was easy

### Day 6: July 06, 2021

**Today's Progress**: functions and while loops.  

**Thoughts:** Finally arrived at creating our own functions. The interactive challenges and the final project was done in a web app called REEBORG's world, the link for which, is available in the Day 6 folder

### Day 7: July 07, 2021

**Today's Progress**: developing a Hangman game.  

**Thoughts:** Finally, a day that was interesting. Had to look up a lot of things like the os library to clear the screen, and enumerate() to get the positions of characters.

### Day 8: July 08, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Code for Caesar cipher

**Thoughts:** Got to use some functions as part of the actual course content. Missed a key logic for the shift values being greater than the number of alphabets until I checked the solution for the final comparison, but corrected it. And I got to do it without repeating the alphabet set like in the course solution, so I am happy about that.

### Day 9: July 09, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Code for Silent Auction

**Thoughts:** Nested dictionaries and lists were a bit confusing, escpecially there were multiple branches. But managed to overcome that.
