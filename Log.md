# Log of my progress in the 100-Days-of-Code Challenge : 

### Day 1: July 01, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Strings and Variables...Yay!!!

**Thoughts:** Since it is just Day 1 , the load was on the lighter side. More time to figure out how to use git...

### Day 2: July 02, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Type casting, operators and fstrings. 

**Thoughts:** First I'm seeing fstrings. real useful, those. also, did a teeny program to calculate the days until you reach 90 and inevitably die. Dark, but I am still proud of it.

### Day 3: July 03, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Conditional statements and logical operators.  

**Thoughts:** Mostly basic stuff. The project was to develop a treasure hunt game, and although it wasn't that difficult, I had fun thinking of possible scenarios.
