# Day 5 of coding:
# Today's project : Password Generator

This one is quite simple. You enter the total number of characters you want your password to be, then you choose how many numbers and symbols you want in the password. You can choose 0 as well, if you dont want any. 

The code then uses the random module to generate a password for you. 

I have also included an .exe file, just because its easier for others to see the working and because I like creating executable files.
