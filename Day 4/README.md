# Day 4 of coding : 

So, you can see 3 pieces of code in the folder. The one named *RPS_course solution* is the one thats kinda done according to the level taught in the course for Day 4. It's a simple game of Rock Paper Scissors that you can play, but play it only once per Execution.

The other file *Rock Paper Scissiors* has the code that I did, where you can play multiple, potentially infinite number of games on the same execution. Yes its still text based, so it might get boring soon, but its there if you want it. 

Check the code and I have also tried to explain in the comments why I did what I did.

The file named **hand_cricket.py** is a CLI version of a game, that is much similar to Rock Paper Scissors. It is a game that has pulled me through multiple boring nights in world devoid of internet. Refer to the *Rules for Hand Cricket.md* I have created for a better understanding of the game. 

## Also, there's an executable version of the Game in the folder. Do check it out
