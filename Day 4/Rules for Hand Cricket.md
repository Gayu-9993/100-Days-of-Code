# Rules : 

    You first choose an option for odd or even

    Then you choose a number. 

    Based on the sum of your number and the computer's , the toss will be decided. 

    If the toss is  what you've chosen, then you get to pick whether to Bat first or Bowl.

    If you lost the toss, the computer chooses either batting or bowling. 

    You enter numbers between 1 and 6. 0 to defend when Batting..
    (You only get 3 defends in a row, so beware)

    If what you chose and what the computer chose match, then whoever's Batting is out. 

    The other player gets to Bat next. 

    For the sake of time sensibility, I have limited the max score to around 200. The moment any player crosses it, they are out. Can let them play a test match here. 

    Once both sides play their roles, the Winner is declared. 


Really hope the instructions are clear. You are welcome to review the code and raise issues for anything you might think is wrong.
