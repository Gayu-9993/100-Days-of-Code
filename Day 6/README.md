# Day 6 of coding : 

Today's code will be a bit different as it's not a python script,but rather a application specific one if I understand it right.

That's the link for the activity, and the objective is to guide the robot to the exit, wherever he might placed at. We will be given the prebuilt statements to control the robot and can use the conditional operations, loops and functions from python to use those robot commands in a meaningful way. 

The solution I did for the robot to be able to navigate the maze is in the text file.
