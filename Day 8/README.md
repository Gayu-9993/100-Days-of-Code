# Day 8 of coding : 

This is a simple program that uses caesar cipher logic to encrypt and decrypt a string. 
It prompts the user to choose either to encode or decode the string, the string itself and the key
It then shifts the alphabets by the key value given, keeping the numbers and other special characters same 
This program can be made to run in an infinite loop should the user choose to.
