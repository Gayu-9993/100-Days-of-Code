# Day 18 of coding : Damien Hirst's spot painting using Turtle

Today's coding exercise was to mimic Damien Hirst's popular spot paintings using colorgram and Turtle modules. I am using colorgram module to extract the colors from an image and using Turtle to display the spots. 

Note : This code requires a jpeg image in the same folder as the code.
